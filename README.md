# Planet Name Generator for No Man's Sky

### Current App Size ~9MB

### TL;DR:
I've created an Android app based off of Reddior's [/u/IIIAnomalyIII](https://www.reddit.com/user/IIIAnomalyIII) naming convention from the [/r/noman'sskythegame](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/) subbreddit. Currently it is lacking in many features but is functional. I plan to be adding features to this regularly and would love your feedback on reddit [/u/Tyfighter98](https://www.reddit.com/user/Tyfighter98/) or here on GitHub via a [bug report](https://github.com/Tyfighter98/NMS-Name-Genorator/issues).

#### Installation:
1. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/Tyfighter98/NMS-Name-Genorator/releases) section of this project
2. Save/move the file to your android device
3. Click on the file in your favorite file manager<sup>1</sup>
4. ~~Behold Sean Murray~~
5. Begin naming plants :D

### For All You Avid Readers:
This Android app (Sorry iPhone users only dabbled in Android ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) is designed to simplify the process of using [/u/IIIAnomalyIII](https://www.reddit.com/user/IIIAnomalyIII) naming convention. The app is compatible with Android v4.3 (Jelly Bean) up to v6.0 (Marshmallow) officially and has been physically tested on my personal Nexus 6P and is at the very least rendered on a few virtual Nexus devices so mileage could vary from phone to phone. The app is very bare currently but I plan to fix that as time goes as well as add new features. This app is a personal project of my own and as such I will never add ads to it and would love feedback from users. The app is currently only available in the [releases](https://github.com/Tyfighter98/NMS-Name-Genorator/releases) section of this project but I hope to put it on the Play Store as soon as things start shaping up. Feel free to leave [bug reports](https://github.com/Tyfighter98/NMS-Name-Genorator/issues) here on GitHub or message me personally on Reddit [/u/Tyfighter98](https://www.reddit.com/user/Tyfighter98/).

### Current Features:
1. Users can **TYPE** descriptions of planets in designated categories
    * The typed information must match that of the naming convention to avoid an error
    * Each word in the entry must be **CAPITALIZED**

### Future Features:
1. Drop down menus for each planet description to avoid errors
2. Better display of generated name
    * Allow users to copy/past name
3. Local database so users can keep track of their planet names
4. Better app icon (would love one from a user :D)

<sup>1</sup> By default Android doesn't let you install apps that aren't from the Play Store so just go to Settings->Security-> and turn on "Unknown Sources"
